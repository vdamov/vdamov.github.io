                            Sophia is a social humanoid robot developed by Hong Kong-based company Hanson Robotics.
                            Sophia
                            was activated on April 19, 2015 and made her first public appearance at South by Southwest
                            Festival (SXSW) in mid-March 2016 in Austin, Texas, United States. She is able to display
                            more than 62 facial expressions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sophia has been covered by media around the globe and has participated in many high-profile
                            interviews. While interviewers around the world have been impressed by the sophistication of
                            many of Sophia's responses to their questions, the bulk of Sophia's meaningful statements
                            are
                            believed by experts to be somewhat scripted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In October 2017, the robot became a Saudi Arabian citizen, the first robot to receive
                            citizenship of any country. In November 2017, Sophia was named the United Nations
                            Development
                            Programme's first ever Innovation Champion, and the first non-human to be given any United
                            Nations title.
