                        <h2>Sofia - the social Robot?</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        Sophia is a social humanoid robot developed by Hong Kong-based company Hanson Robotics. Sophia
                        was activated on April 19, 2015 and made her first public appearance at South by Southwest
                        Festival (SXSW) in mid-March 2016 in Austin, Texas, United States. She is able to display
                        more than 62 facial expressions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sophia has been covered by media around the globe and has participated in many high-profile
                        interviews. While interviewers around the world have been impressed by the sophistication of
                        many of Sophia's responses to their questions, the bulk of Sophia's meaningful statements are
                        believed by experts to be somewhat scripted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In October 2017, the robot became a Saudi Arabian citizen, the first robot to receive
                        citizenship of any country. In November 2017, Sophia was named the United Nations Development
                        Programme's first ever Innovation Champion, and the first non-human to be given any United
                        Nations title.

                    <h4>History</h4>
                    <p>
                        Sophia was created by Hanson Robotics in collaboration with AI developers, including Googleâ€™s
                        parent company Alphabet Inc, who built her voice recognition system, and SingularityNET, which
                        powers her brain.
                    </p>
                    <p>Sophia was activated on April 19, 2015. The robot, modeled after actress Audrey Hepburn, is
                        known for her human-like appearance and behavior compared to previous robotic variants.
                        According to the manufacturer, David Hanson, Sophia uses artificial intelligence, visual data
                        processing and facial recognition. Sophia also imitates human gestures and facial expressions
                        and is able to answer certain questions and to make simple conversations on predefined topics
                        (e.g. on the weather). Sophia uses voice recognition technology from Alphabet Inc. (parent
                        company of Google) and is designed to get smarter over time. Sophia's intelligence software
                        is designed by SingularityNET. The AI program analyses conversations and extracts data that
                        allows her to improve responses in the future.</p>
